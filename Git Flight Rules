Git Flight Rules Overview

Git Flight Rules are a set of guidelines that help teams use Git effectively and avoid common pitfalls. They provide a framework for collaboration, ensuring a smooth workflow in version control.

 Key Points of Git Flight Rules

1. Commit Often
   - Key Point: Regular commits create a detailed history of changes, making it easier to track progress and revert if necessary.
   - Example: Instead of making one large commit after completing a feature, commit every time you complete a logical chunk of work:
     ```bash
     git add file1.txt
     git commit -m "Implement feature X"
     git add file2.txt
     git commit -m "Fix bug in feature X"
     ```

2. Use Meaningful Commit Messages
   - Key Point: Clear and descriptive commit messages help team members understand the purpose of changes.
   - Example: Instead of vague messages like "fix stuff," use:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Fix user authentication issue when logging in"
     ```

3. Branching Strategies
   - Key Point: Use branches to manage features, fixes, and experiments. This keeps the main branch stable.
   - Example: Create a new branch for a feature:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/new-feature
     ```

4. Merge Regularly
   - Key Point: Regularly merge changes from the main branch into your feature branch to minimize conflicts.
   - Example: While working on a feature branch, periodically pull from the main branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git pull origin main
     git checkout feature/new-feature
     git merge main
     ```

5. Rebase for Clean History
   - Key Point: Use `rebase` to keep a clean, linear project history. This can make it easier to understand the projectâ€™s evolution.
   - Example: Before merging your feature branch, rebase it onto the latest main branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout feature/new-feature
     git rebase main
     ```

6. Avoid Force Pushes
   - Key Point: Force pushing can overwrite history and disrupt team workflows. Use it only when necessary and after communication with the team.
   - Example: Instead of `git push --force`, consider using:
     ```bash
     git push --force-with-lease
     ```
   - This ensures you don't overwrite others' work.

7. Backup Before Major Changes
   - Key Point: Always back up your work before performing operations that might change history, like `reset` or `rebase`.
   - Example: Create a temporary branch to back up your current work:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b backup/my-feature
     ```

8. Communicate Changes
   - Key Point: Keep your team informed about significant changes, especially those that affect shared branches or important features.
   - Example: Use team channels or commit messages to update on major changes.

Conclusion

Git Flight Rules help maintain a clean, efficient, and collaborative workflow. By adhering to these guidelines, teams can minimize conflicts, improve communication, and enhance project visibility.
