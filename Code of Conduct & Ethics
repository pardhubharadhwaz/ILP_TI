Ethics and morality. morality is our personal set of beliefs or gut feeling of what is right and wrong. whereas ethics are the shared standards expected from everyone. Here's an analogy. You wouldn't steal candy from a baby because it feels wrong and makes you uneasy...That's morality. At school. There's a rule against cheating, even if you think you can get away with it. That's ethics. Sometimes the needles point in the same direction. Sharing candy with a friend is both morally good and ethically considered polite. But sometimes they might not. Lying to protect someone might feel morally right, but it might break an ethical code of honesty. So both ethics and morality deal with right and wrong. But morality is personal. It's about your guiding principles. While ethics are shared, they are the collective guidelines your group follows. It's like a team playing a game. Morality is your internal sense of fair play. While ethics are the agreed upon rules of the game, everyone has to follow for it to be fun and fair for all. Just remember, navigating right and wrong isn't always black and white, but having both your personal compass and the shared rules to consider can help you make good choices. Differentiating between personal and professional ethics. Think of ethics as two circles. The first circle is the inner circle, which consists of your personal ethics. These are your own values and principles that guide your behavior in all aspects of life, like honesty, kindness, or fairness. They're shaped by your upbringing, experiences and beliefs. You get to decide how strictly you follow them, as long as you don't harm others. The second circle is the outer circle, which consists of your professional ethics. These are the specific rules and standards expected from you in your workplace or field. They are often written down in codes of conduct or industry best practices. Following them is not optional. It's part of your professional responsibility. Here's an example. You might believe in always telling the truth. This is personal ethics. As a doctor, you have a professional obligation to keep patient information confidential, even if it means not being completely honest with someone else. This is professional ethics. So the key difference is personal ethics are flexible and personal, like your own moral compass. While professional ethics are more rigid and external, like traffic rules on the road of your career. Both are important and sometimes they might overlap or even clash. If that happens, you'll need to carefully consider both sets of ethics and make a decision that feels right for you and aligns with your professional obligations. Both your personal and professional ethics contribute to your overall character and reputation. So strive to be someone who acts with integrity in both spheres of your life.
