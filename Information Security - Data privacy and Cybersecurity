Information security directly impacts individuals as well as virtually all types of businesses in today's digital age.We constantly hear about cyber attacks on organizations companies government entities and even celebrities from a variety of sources.However despite the amount of time we spend and sensitive information we keep online.Many of us have limited to no knowledge about how to keep our data and information safe in this privacy and security course. Information security is the practice of defending all types of information from unauthorized access.This can include the information we work with the information we use to buy things the information that tells us who we are and the information we access ourselves.The goal of information security is to ensure its confidentiality integrity and availability.These key points are crucial to successful information security and have thus been deemed the CIA triad.Please safeguard our sensitive information from unauthorized access and modification to prevent alterations unauthorized transfers and stolen information while making sure that anyone with authorization can get instant access to this data.I.T. security stands for information technology security which is an aspect of information security as a whole.And while your tech department should have processes in place for responding to and mitigating counterattacks these attacks are often launched by targeting the unsuspecting administrative managerial another non-technical staff members of an organization. I.T. Security is the purely technical aspect of information security with tools like firewalls and encryption.That's why hackers typically target you over your staff.They know that if they can get you to give them your authentication they don't have to crack passwords or break through your company's firewall to get the information they're looking for.And of course they have numerous tricks and gimmicks to get you to give them your authentication.Much like your car safety routine efficient information security also requires a routine of steps to prevent security breaches as well as various methods to mitigate attacks that may occur with a clear course of action and processes in place.
So as the analogy indicates privacy means that only certain people can see the sites you access the apps you download or the videos you watch.Security means that you are safe from malware hackers and fraud and anonymity means that your Internet activity goes unnoticed.Nobody can trace the source of your actions in information security.These concepts are all interconnected with him taking a safe and secure network.Security often improves privacy.For instance if you encrypt your files then only someone with authentication can access his files.However you can have security without privacy such as a patent or copyright or privacy without security.Like text messages text messages also convey the difference between anonymity and privacy on the Internet.You aren't anonymous because the person you're texting knows who you are.However you are private because only YouTube can read the messages.
However security issues often emerge from inside an organization itself.The key problem with insider threats is that they're often unintentional insiders like yourself have access to sensitive information on a regular basis and you may not know exactly how that information's protected.Someone who wants to steal or leak that data can usually do so with far greater ease than trying to breach the company from the outside to steal that data whether by attaching the wrong file to an email being sent over sharing on social media losing a laptop or USP drive or through some other mistake.Insiders can put an organization's data at risk without their direct knowledge or effort.Insiders like yourself can introduce a virus through an NSF w download except malware through a fishing exploit introduce a corrupt mobile device be wild to the corporate network or engage in some sort of inadvertent human error which may result in a threat to data security.Often these sorts of threats are ignited due to overlooking things like failing to update security settings using tired and overly simplistic passwords or doing secure work on an insecure public network.It is very easy for outside actors to take full advantage of these insiders vulnerabilities.One example you've likely heard about in the news is target being hacked and millions of credit card numbers stolen.The hackers managed this feat by stealing the username and password of an authorized vendor.This gave them unlimited access to the target network without triggering any alarms or raising any suspicion.Hackers are no longer breaking in through back doors which may trigger alarms.Today they're stealing the keys of authorized users and walking right through the front door.
First on our list the computer virus you have probably already heard of this one.It is a software that can copy itself in order to damage your computer as well as corrupting your system and damaging your data.It might sound as if it is interchangeable with malware.However while all viruses are malware not all malware or viruses.Secondly the computer worm a self-replicating computer program penetrates an operating system with the intent of spreading malicious code worms utilize networks to send copies of the original code to other computers causing harm by consuming bandwidth or possibly deleting files or sending documents via email.Worms are quite similar to viruses.The difference lies in how they spread computer worm self-replicate and spread across networks exploiting vulnerabilities automatically.That is they don't need a cyber criminals guidance nor do they need to latch onto another computer program.Third on our list the Trojan horse a concept born in ancient Greece the Trojan horse appears friendly and inviting on the surface but uses this front to cause harm.Tricking you into clicking a link or downloading a file.The Trojan Horse installs malicious code on your computer.These can be email attachments free games movies even greeting cards.So always be alert.Avoid downloading unknown file extensions like Dot SC vs and dot the 80 from emails and Web sites and always use an antivirus to prevent your computer from getting bogged down.Now everyone hates pop ups but did you know they are actually a form of malware called Ad ware last on our last ad where bombards users with various pop up windows which can be dangerous to your devices while most hardware is safe albeit annoying.Some can be used to gather personal information tracked the Web site you visit and record your keystrokes.Where often built into free software but can also be downloaded onto your browser or operating system through a security hole.Luckily you can apply simple general practices to treat and protect your computer before removing malware with an anti-malware software always backup your files to ensure their safety.You can prevent ad ware and other malware by keeping your applications browsers and anti-malware unto date and use a firewall when accessing the internet.Of course prevention is the best cure.
Practicing information security at work involves implementing various strategies and best practices across different aspects.
1. Password Security
- Strong Passwords: Use complex passwords that combine uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid easily guessable information.
- Password Managers: Utilize password management tools to store and generate strong passwords securely.
- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Enable 2FA wherever possible for an added layer of security.
- Regular Updates: Change passwords regularly and avoid reusing passwords across different accounts.

2. Malware Security
- Antivirus Software: Install and regularly update antivirus and anti-malware software to detect and eliminate threats.
- Regular Updates: Keep all software and operating systems updated to patch vulnerabilities.
- Safe Browsing Practices: Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown sources.
- File Backups: Regularly back up important data to recover it in case of a malware attack.

3. Email Security
